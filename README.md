Hi Find my project code here ,

The url for the application is ## https://angular-g5pmqe.stackblitz.io ##

Note please add the chrome plug in Allow-Control-Allow-Origin bfr hitting the url

I coudnt get the response from the first url as it was giving me an authorization issue so have made a json object and have read the values from it.

The second api works fine and populating the chart based on the response.
